# Equation Solver
A free-format equation solver which solves three types of mathematical equations:
* linear (one unknown)
* simultaneous (two unknowns)
* quadratic (one unknown but raised to 2)

This solver uses the variables 'x' and 'y'.
One point to remember is to enter 'x' or 'y' as '1x' or '1y'.
